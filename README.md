# Obsidian Wikilink Zettelkasten

Best for personal/private knowledge repository: this is my declarative workflow and structure of a Zettelkasten using [Obsidian's Wikilink formats for internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Supported+formats+for+internal+links). I've tried to streamline the process of how to use the Zettelkasten system to enable one to be less of a content consumer, and become empowered to create content of their own via published works.
