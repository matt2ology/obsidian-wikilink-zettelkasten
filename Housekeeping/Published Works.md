# Published Works

How this fits in [[The Workflow]]

- **Links to:** the atomic notes that contributed to the finished published work
- **Does not link to:** daily notes or reference notes

Published works link back to the atomic notes that contributed to the finish published work.

**Purpose:** to make use of and leverage all of your time, effort, learning, and knowledge gained to share with the world (or just a few family and friends). This is your opportunity to make an impact and share your perspectives and insights. The published work is your created project to produce work that is shareable via a link. Think blogs, a public journal, YouTube, etc. If the content is not a blog to be published then it can house an outline or a script for a video, a manuscript, a podcast script, a song, a piece of code, or anything else you can imagine.
