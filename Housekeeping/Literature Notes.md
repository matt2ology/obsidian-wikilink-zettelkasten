# Literature Notes

How this fits in [[The Workflow]]

Note templates: [[../Templates/Literature Note]], [[Meeting Summary Note]]

- **Proposed File naming convention:** Author's last name - source title
- **Links to:** other literature notes and to atomic notes
- **Does not link to:** daily notes or reference notes

This note links back to the reference note, link to other related literature notes, and link to other atomic notes.

**Purpose:** This is your high level summary written in your own words. These notes are your own interpretation of the thoughts, ideas, and concepts highlighted in your reference notes captured/copied from the source material you've consumed (i.e. article, book, conversation, meeting, podcast, poem, video, etc.). You get to pick and choose what highlights to reference and further make note of and expand upon. Not all highlights from the reference note is needed to illustrate the overall summary.
