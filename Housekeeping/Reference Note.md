# Reference Note

How this fits in [[The Workflow]]

Note Templates: [[Reference Note]], [[Meeting Note]]

- **Proposed file naming convention:** Author's last name - source title
- **Does not link to:** any note, for you'd want the summaries of your reference notes (AKA your literature notes) to drive your personal insight and perspectives (as _literature notes_ were written in your own words and came from your insights, interpretations, and perspectives)

**Purpose:** It's recommended that you have a reference management software integration that you can save as markdown. Otherwise it's the raw capture, in the moment, of the medium you're consuming anything from article, book, podcast, poem, video and even a conversation, a lecture, or a meeting. This note captures un-doctored direct quotes, extrapolated data results, source concept and ideas, and the alike.

### Create Unique Note

The `Create New Unique Note` setting is enabled and is defaulted to use the [[Meeting Note]] template. New, Zettelkasten styled, unique notes are meant to serve as "OMG, I'm meeting with someone right now and I need a new note to capture what we've discussed". After the meeting one is then free to rename the title of the note and fill in miscellaneous details (e.g. attendees of the meeting).
