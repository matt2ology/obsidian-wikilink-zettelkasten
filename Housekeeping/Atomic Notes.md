# Atomic Notes

How this fits in [[The Workflow]]

Note template: [[Atomic Note]]

- **Proposed File naming convention:**
  - The key concept or idea
  - A question: who, what, when, where, why, or how - be sure to use aliases too to remove the question part of said key figure, object, location, situation, etc.
- **Links to:** other atomic notes and published works
- **Does not link to:** daily notes or reference notes

This not does not link back to literature notes. Links to other related atomic notes.

**Purpose:** The note is short and concise, is made to be "atomic", as much as possible (i.e. the content should be above the fold: you should not have to scroll to gain understanding). It should be relatively easy to understand by anyone ignorant of the field, topic, domain, and/or original context. Also referred or known as "permanent notes" or "evergreen notes". I've chosen "atomic notes" for it better describes what the note should be... Calling it "permanent" is a little presumptuous.

Components of a good quality atomic note are:

1. The note is atomic: the note encapsulates 1 and only 1 idea or concept.
2. The note is short and concise as much as possible (i.e. the content should be above the fold: you should not have to scroll to gain understanding). It should be relatively easy to understand by anyone ignorant of the field, topic, domain, and/or original context.
3. The atomic note, via [Wikilink](https://help.obsidian.md/web-clipper/filters#%60wikilink%60): `[[Multi-tasking myth]]` or [Markdown link](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Supported+formats+for+internal+links): `[Multi-tasking myth](Multi-tasking myth)`, internally links out to at least one (or more) atomic note.
